# straight-skeletons
An interactive visualization of straight skeletons and their construction.

A straight skeleton is a representation of a polygon by a skeleton. The edges of the polygon are moved inwards parallel to themselves at constat speed. This process is called shrinking. The straight skeleton is the set of lines traced out by moving vertices in this process.

Given a polygon, we implement a shrinking algorithm that constructs the straight skeleton. An example starts with a polygon (left) and constructs the straight skeleton (middle). This can be applied to construciton of a roof with constant slope over a polygonal building (right):
